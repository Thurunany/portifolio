I am a passionate professional in **DevOps** and **Data Engineering**, with experience in process automation, continuous integration, and cloud environment management. My expertise lies in optimizing **data pipelines** and ensuring high system availability, with a focus on improving efficiency and product quality.

Currently, I am pursuing a **Technology in Systems Analysis and Development** degree at the **State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC)**, expected to graduate in **December 2025**.

I am motivated by **problem-solving** and the continuous pursuit of improvement. I believe that **automation** and **continuous integration** are key to delivering agile and high-quality solutions.

This website was built using **Hugo**, a fast and flexible static site generator, which allowed for a smooth and efficient development process.
